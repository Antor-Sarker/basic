/*Create four functions named add, subtract, multiply, and divide that perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. Each function should take two parameters and return the result of the corresponding arithmetic operation.
Instructions:
Addition Function:
Create a function named add.
The function should take two parameters.
It should return the sum of the two parameters.
Example: add(5, 10) should return 15.
Subtraction Function:
Create a function named subtract.
The function should take two parameters.
It should return the difference between the first and second parameter.
Example: subtract(10, 4) should return 6.
Multiplication Function:
Create a function named multiply.
The function should take two parameters.
It should return the product of the two parameters.
Example: multiply(3, 7) should return 21.
Division Function:
Create a function named divide.
The function should take two parameters.
It should return the result of dividing the first parameter by the second parameter.
Example: divide(20, 5) should return 4.
